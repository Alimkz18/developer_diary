## 🌌 About Me
My name is **Alim Zhainakov**, and I am deeply motivated to create, learn, and grow every single day.

## 🚀 Vision — Halcyonova
I founded the idea of **Halcyonova**, a future company and creative brand that represents:  
- 🌍 **Innovation** — building something the world has not seen yet

## 🔒 Why Cybersecurity Matters in Game Development
Games are not only about creativity and fun — they must also be **secure and fair**.  
By combining my knowledge of **cybersecurity** and **game development**, I aim to:  
- Build **anti-cheat systems** to keep gameplay fair.  
- Protect player accounts and data from hacks.  
- Secure online features against exploits and vulnerabilities.  
- Ensure that player **trust and experience** are as strong as the game itself.  

This unique perspective allows me to design games that are not only engaging but also **resilient against cheats and attacks**.
